# Coding with Lasair

The recommended way to write code against the Lasair database is by
the [python client for Lasair ](https://pypi.org/project/lasair/):
```
pip3 install lasair
```
The documentation is in the page [Lasair Client](../core_functions/client.html).
The client also has methods to consume alerts from an active filter -- [see here](core_functions/alert-streams.html).
There are a number of [python notebooks](../core_functions/python-notebooks.html) that show how to use the Lasair client.

The underlying REST API explained in the page [Lasair API](../core_functions/rest-api.html).
