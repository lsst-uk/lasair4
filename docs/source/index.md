# [Lasair: A UK Alert Stream Broker]({%lasairurl%})

[*Lasair*]({%lasairurl%}) is being developed by The University of Edinburgh, Queen\'s University Belfast,
and Oxford University with the ultimate goal of serving transient alerts from the 
future [Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org) to the 
astronomical community. *Lasair* (pronounced '*L-AH-s-uh-r*') means flame or 
flash in Scots and Irish gaelic. To prototype functionality needed to process transient 
event alerts from LSST, Lasair is currently processing and serving data from the 
public stream of the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](http://www.ztf.caltech.edu/), 
which is releasing a transient alert stream in a format similar to that 
envisaged for LSST. We thank ZTF for access to this valuable public data stream.

If you make use of [Lasair]({%lasairurl%}) in any of your work, please remember to cite our paper: [R.D.Williams et. al., 
Enabling science from the Rubin alert stream with Lasair](https://doi.org/10.1093/rasti/rzae024),
