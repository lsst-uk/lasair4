## About Lasair
The [Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/)
will provide unprecedented temporal resolution, depth and 
uniform photometry over an entire hemisphere, along with a real-time stream of 
alerts from the ever changing sky. To extract the scientific potential from 
that stream, the community needs brokers that offer the ability to filter, 
query, and manipulate the alerts, and combine them with external data sources. 
The [LSST:UK consortium](https://www.lsst.ac.uk/)
has been building just such a broker [Lasair](http://lasair.lsst.ac.uk), alongside 
an International Data Access Centre (IDAC), building on its strengths and 
heritage in leading astronomical surveys, data processing and analysis. The hope
is that Lasair will be of value to the worldwide community, not just to the the UK consortium.

## The Lasair approach
**Lasair is a platform for scientists to make science; it does not try to make 
the science itself.**
Every LSST broker aims to filter the stream, but Lasair does this differently. 
Rather than scientists making python code that needs to be vetted, Lasair 
offers direct access with a staged approach: scientists can start with a 
simple, immediate mechanism using familiar SQL-like languages. These SQL-like 
queries can be custom made or users can choose and modify one of our pre-built 
and tested queries. These queries return an initial selection of objects, based 
on our rich value-added data content, and users can then run their own local 
code on the results. Users can build up to running  their own code on both the 
stream and the database with high-throughput resources in the 
UK science collaboration called [IRIS](https://www.iris.ac.uk/). The 
SQL filters and code can be made public, shared with a group of colleagues, 
copied, and edited.
SQL filters can be escalated from static (run on command) to streaming filters, 
that run whenever new alerts arrive. A broad overview of the Lasair design is 
given in the diagram below.

## How Lasair Works
Lasair runs in the Somerville computing cloud at the Advanced Computing Facility 
near Edinburgh, Scotland. 

<img src="_images/Architecture.png" width="700px"/>

Lasair ingests data with a pipeline of clusters: each cluster does a different 
job, some more compute/data intensive than others, so it is difficult to know a 
priori how much resource should be allocated to each. Our design gives 
flexibility: each cluster can be grown or reduced according to need. Also, 
there are various persistent data stores, again, each is driven by a resilient 
cluster that can be grown or reduced according to need. The diagram shows the 
concept: data enters the Kafka system on the left and progresses to the right. 
The green cluster reads, processes, and puts different data into the Kafka bus; 
as soon as that starts the yellow cluster pulls and pushes; eventually the 
whole pipeline is working. The clusters may also be reading and writing the 
data stores.
We also include the web and annotator nodes in this picture (bottom and right), 
as well as the mining nodes, although they are not part of the data ingestion 
pipeline. The web server nodes support users by delivering web pages and 
responding to API requests. The annotator nodes may be far from the Lasair 
computing centre and not controlled by us, but they are in this picture because 
just like the others, they push data into the data storage and may read from 
Kafka.

The Kafka system is represented by the green nodes in the diagram as well as the 
grey arrow at the top. It is responsible for reading and caching the alert 
packets from the USA, as well as sending it to the compute nodes and receiving 
their resulting packets.

The Ingest nodes read the original alerts alerts from the Kafka system, and 
puts the cutout images in the shared filesystem, the recent lightcurve to NoSQL 
(Cassandra) database, then reformats the alert as JSON – since there is no 
binary content – then pushes that into the Kafka system. 

Each Sherlock node has a SQL database of 5 Tbytes of astronomical sources from 
~40 catalogues. The sky position of the input alert is used to intelligently 
decide on the most likely associated source from the catalogues, finding out, 
for example, if the alert is associated with a known galaxy, or if the alert is 
a flare from a known CV (cataclysmic variable). 

Each filter node computes features of the 30-day light curve that comes with 
the alert (a year with LSST), as well as matching the alert against user-made 
watchlists and areas. Records are writen to a local SQL database onboard the 
node for the object and features, the Sherlock data, the watchlist and area 
tags. Other tables have already been copied into the local database from the 
main SQL database (see Background Services below). After a batch of perhaps 
10,000 alerts are ingested to the local database, it can now execute the 
user-made queries and push out results via the public Kafka system – or via 
email if the user has chosen this option. **NOTE** User-made queries have a time-out 
of 10 seconds, so they can't hold up the entire system if they are too resource intensive.
Usually, however, a user query will execute in a second or less since there are only 10,000
objects in the local database.

The tables in the local database are 
then pushed to the main SQL database and replace any earlier information where 
and object is already known. Once a batch is finished, the local database 
tables are truncated and a new batch started.

The Lasair webserver and API server allow users to control their interactions 
with the alert database and the stream. They can create a watchlist of their 
interesting sources, and Lasair will report crossmatches with members of the 
watchlist. They can define regions of the sky, and Lasair will report when 
alerts fall inside a region. They can define and save SQL queries that can run 
in real time as filters on the alert stream.

The Lasair API supports annotation: a structured external packet of extra 
information about a given object, that is stored in the annotations table in 
the SQL database. This could be, the result of running a machine-learning 
algorithm on the lightcurve, the classification created by another broker, or 
data from a follow-up observation on the object, for example a link to a 
spectrum. Users that put annotations into the Lasair database are vetted, and 
administrators then make it possible. That user will run a method in the Lasair 
API that pushes the annotation: all this can be automated, meaning the 
annotation may arrive within minutes of the observation that triggers it.

## ZTF and LSST
The Lasair project splits into two: the existing working version, Lasair-ZTF, 
that has been ingesting and exposing alerts from the ZTF survey for two years; 
and the future version Lasair-LSST, which is being developed based on the 
lessons learned from Lasair-ZTF. We are keeping the essentials of the user 
interface of Lasair-ZTF (static and streaming SQL queries, full database 
access, watchlists, classification and annotation), but are rebuilding the 
backend architecture for LSST event rates, using parallel services and scalable 
software.

In the timeframe beyond the first data releases of LSST, we can expect 
continuing change. New surveys will come on line, new robotic follow-up 
systems, and new classification systems will proliferate, leading to more 
real-time transient streams and derived information. Just as cross-matching of 
static catalogues has gained importance in the last years, so *dynamic* 
cross-matching will become an engine of discovery: those transients observed by 
A and B, or classified in contradiction by C and D. While the bulk of data will 
continue to be dominated by Rubin data, there will be a deluge of metadata and 
annotation. Lasair will be well-suited to this challenge, building on our existing 
mechanisms for dynamic cross-match (e.g. the IAU's Transient Name Server) and 
utilising our flexible schema system. Lasair will add new tables and schemas to 
our databases, and build information systems to make it easy for scientists to 
navigate the deluge of metadata.

## What Lasair is not
Lasair is built to process transient alerts rapidly and make the key decision: is this an object I want to follow up? LSST alerts will come at very high rate, and Lasair takes advantage of the design of the distribution system: ["Events are sent in rich alert packets to enable standalone classification"](https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/9308/bellmlsst180226.pdf). Thus alerts are judged based only on that rich alert packet, without database interaction, leading to a very fast processing rate.

The "rich data packet" means a year of past data about each object (or a month for the ZTF prototype). Note that Lasair has the full light curves -- available through the object web page or API -- but queries and filters are based on these shorter light curves.

We note that the calibrated ZTF data releases are [hosted at Caltech](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interface/ztf_api.html) and the LSST archives will hosted by [LSST:UK Science Platform](https://rsp.lsst.ac.uk/) and [Rubin Science Platform](https://data.lsst.cloud). These resources may be better suited for long-term archival research.

## Scientific goals of Lasair
We aim to facilitate all four science themes of LSST within the Lasair 
platform: Dark Matter and Dark Energy, the Solar System, the Changing Sky, and 
the Milky Way. We will do this by providing combined access to the alerts, to 
the annual data releases, and to external data sources, and by providing a 
flexible platform which creative users can adapt to their own ends. Design of 
Lasair is driven by a detailed Science Requirements Document which is available 
on request. 
Below we explore the issues arising from key science topics.

### Extragalactic Transients
Luminous transients outside our own galaxy include supernovae, kilonovae, tidal 
disruption events and AGN flare activity, nuclear transients of unknown origin, 
gamma-ray bursts, stellar mergers, white dwarf - NS/BH mergers, super-luminous 
supernovae and fast blue optical transients. 
These have timescales from hours (GRB afterglows), days (kilonovae and WD-NS/BH 
mergers), to weeks (supernovae, fast blue optical transients), months (TDEs, 
SLSNe, AGN activity) to years (SLSNe at high redshift, AGN and nuclear 
transients, SNe from CSM interaction). 
All of this science requires lightcurves, links to galaxy and redshift 
catalogues, precise astrometric cross-matching, correlation with high energy 
information, multiwavelength cross-matching and our concept of ``tagging'' 
which we introduce here. Objects need to be found on timescales of minutes to 
years due to the intrinsic timescale, which is mostly driven by the mass 
ejected by the transients (through photon diffusion time).  Some scientific 
highlights that Lasair will enable are : 

### Kilonovae and gravitational wave sources
Users will be able to select their own candidates by combining colour, 
lightcurve evolution, host galaxy information and any multi-wavelength 
coincidences using SQL, kafka filtering, or the Lasair API (see section 4). 
This can be used to enable searches for all ``fast-transients'' of timescales 
of minutes to days (e.g. GRB afterglows, orphan afterglows, WD-NS/BH mergers).  

### Massive samples of supernovae 
Lasair will link all transients to a list of likely host galaxies together with 
their photometric redshifts and their spectroscopic redshifts, should they 
exist. We are working closely with the two major ESO projects that will provide 
tens of thousands of spectra for LSST supernovae. 
We will coordinate SN discoveries in Lasair with spectra from the 4MOST 
multi-fibre spectrometer on the ESO VISTA telescope. 
We will provide DESC with the ability to select 35,000 live transients for 
spectra and obtain spectra of 70,000 host galaxies in the TiDES (Time Domain 
Extragalactic Survey). 
This will provide the largest cosmological sample of type Ia SNe, together 
with a massive statistical sample to understand supernova explosion physics 
across a range of redshifts and host galaxy masses and metallicities. Lasair 
will provide both (reproducible) selection and extract the scientific content 
(type, phase, redshift etc) to re-ingest into the broker for user exploitation. 
We are also working closely with the UK team responsible for the science 
software infrastructure behind SOXS on ESO's New Technology Telescope.  This is 
a 0.35-2$\mu$m spectrometer and ESO are fully dedicating the NTT to time domain 
science, with the schedule being run by the SOXS consortium. 
We will enable the SOXS marshall and rapid data analysis pipeline to interface 
with Lasair, to select LSST transients ($\sim$ few$\times10^{3}$) for 
classification and re-ingest the information and public data for all users to 
access. 

### AGN, TDEs and long lived transients
Similar to the above, we will allow users to select known AGN, upload their own 
AGN catalogues, and select flaring events in both active and passive galaxies. 
This will support the science of tidal disruption events, changing look 
quasars, AGN flares, microlensing of background QSOs by foreground galaxies, 
and unusual long lived nuclear transients. Lasair will match radio and X-ray 
archival data with optical spectra, and the LSST lightcurves. Users will be 
able to select on these criteria or upload their own watch list to Lasair to 
combine with lightcurve parameters. 

### Milky Way and Local Group stellar transients
Within the TVS Science Collaboration most science for variables (typically 
recurrent and periodic signals) will be achieved with the annual data releases. 
However there is great opportunity in combining alerts with the data releases. 
Users can discover outbursts or large amplitude variability through the alerts 
and link to the data releases and full multi-year lightcurves. Lasair-ZTF 
currently can provide streams of objects matched to known stars (via watch 
lists of $10^6$ objects) and trigger on a particular magnitude variability 
index. We are working with scientists within TVS in particular to define 
features that can be measured on the incoming stream and used to provide 
alerts.  For example, outbursts of [AM CVn stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_Canum_Venaticorum_star) 
which are then linked to the binary system's long term lightcurve 
Lasair-LSST will expand on its current functionality to provide 
seamless cross-links to the data releases within the UK IDAC infrastructure. 

### Solar System objects
LSST will provide an unprecedented opportunity for time-domain Solar System 
science.

### New types of transient
In the future, we can expect surprises. The Lasair community has  active groups 
dedicated to finding and following rare events such as superluminous 
supernovae, tidal disruption events, compact stellar mergers and black-hole 
forming supernovae.  
In the future we expect further exotica to emerge, and it is the flexibility of 
Lasair's design which will allow relevant information to be streamed in, joint 
queries to be built and executed in real time, and follow-up facilities alerted 
and activated.
